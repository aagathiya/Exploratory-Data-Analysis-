### Project Overview

 The project deals with Exploratory Data Analysis. The project overall consisted of checking of checking of information and description of data which gives insight of data ie null values, data type, mean, SD,  IQR. It also deals with detecting of  unwanted abbreviation in the data and replacing or imputing with appropriate value like mean, median or mode with imputer function.

Data1 - 
Histogram/Distplot was plotted for target/response variable to check the distribution.
Countplot was plotted for each brand to check the number of vehicle each brand is manufacturing.
Jointplot was plotted between horsepower of the car and price of the car for determining the relationship between the two variables.
Correlation heat map was plotted for determining the correlation between the predictors and response with each other. If predictors are highly correlated any one of the variable is deleted.
Box plot was plotted between body style and car price to determine pricing against the body style. By box plot, it helped to determine upper extreme, upper quartile, median, lower quartile, lower extreme and outlier for each body type.

Data2- 
Informtion and desciption of data was checked. Unwanted symbols was replaced with NaN which was further replaced with mean of the data by imputer function.
Skewness was checked on numeric column of data2 and the column was transformed if skewness was greater than 1. as per graph, it was right skewed or positive skewed.
Label Encoder was applied to columns whch consisted of catgorical data. 
New column was created for area which is equal to width * height


### Learnings from the project

 After completing of the project I learned the following - 
1. EDA has to be done on raw data because Linear and Logistic regression ie model cannot be applied on raw data and it also helps to validate our assumptions after model building.
2.  Determining outlier and there treatment.
3. Detecting of missing data and replacing it with mean, median or mode as per the requirement of the data.
4.  If any symbol is not required then replacing it with the required values.
5. Converting the data type as per the requirement. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I followed the approch that was mentioned on greyatom platform and I tried to analyze the finding as per my knowledge.


### Challenges faced

 Analysis was done with the help of youtube videos, google and my knowledge about the topics.
